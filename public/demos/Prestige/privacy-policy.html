                    <h3>8.1 Access and Portability</h3>
                    <p>
                        You have the right to request access to the personal information we hold about you and 
                        to receive a copy of your information in a commonly used, machine-readable format.
                    </p>

                    <h3>8.2 Correction</h3>
                    <p>
                        You have the right to request that we correct or update inaccurate or incomplete 
                        personal information.

                        exceptions (such as legal obligations or legitimate business interests).

                    <h3>8.4 Opt-Out of Marketing</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can opt out of receiving marketing communications from us by clicking the "unsubscribe" 
                        link in our emails or contacting us directly. Note that you may still receive transactional 
                        emails (such as service updates or account notifications).
                    </p>

                    <h3>8.5 Do Not Track</h3>
                    <p>
                        Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites you do not want 
                        your online activities tracked. We do not currently respond to Do Not Track signals.
                    </p>

                        Privacy Act (CCPA), including the right to know what personal information we collect, 
                        use, and share, and the right to request deletion of your information.
